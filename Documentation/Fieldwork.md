# Trip to the Aletsch Gletscher

Over the summer break I had the privilege of spending a week on the Riederalp, a mid-mountain ski resort close by the Aletsch Glacier. Initially, I planned to do a guided tour across the glacier itself, 
however this wasn't possible due to snow conditions. In any case, I wanted to record sound and 3D scan some of the surrounding area in an effort to be as site-specific as possible, as well as just gathering material I might later find a use for. 

Using the apps *Scaniverse* and *Luma AI*, I scanned some moss from the Aletschwald (LINK, LINK), rocks at the ridge between Riederalp and Bettmeralp, looking straight down onto the glacier (LINK), some rocks outside of our chalet (LINK) and a cross (LINK) and tree (LINK) I came across at Golmenegg. As this trip was a family vacation, I prioritised spending time with my family, not wanting to hold everyone up on a hike by scanning stuff all the time. Aside from the cross, which I sought out to scan, the other scans happened rather spontaneously, during breaks from skiing or hiking.
